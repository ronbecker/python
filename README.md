Just a repo of simple Python scripts I use.

## CleanJaro:
CleanJaro is a really simple script I use to do some basic maintenance on my Manjaro install. It has 5 options not including Exit. Each option will loop back around to the main menu so you can run it once and run every action you want to.

CleanJaro Getting Started:
You have a couple options here.

`cd` into the directory with cleanjaro.py in it, and run `python cleanjaro.py`

or

Place it in your `~/bin` directory, rename it to `cleanjaro` removing the `.py` extension. Then you will need to `chmod +x cleanjaro` to make it executable. As long as your bin folder is in your path you can now run it from anywhere by typing `cleanjaro` in terminal.
